Project Title: Flame Detection System using Arduino Uno

Project Description:

The flame detection system is a crucial safety measure for industries, homes, and vehicles. In this project, we aim to develop a flame detection system using Arduino Uno. The system will detect the presence of a flame and alert the user via an alarm or notification.

The flame detection system will use an IR (infrared) flame sensor module to detect the presence of a flame. The IR sensor module will be connected to the Arduino Uno, which will read the sensor data and analyze it to determine if there is a flame. The Arduino Uno will then trigger an alarm or notification if a flame is detected.

The system will also include an LCD display to show the status of the system and the presence of a flame. Additionally, we will use a Wi-Fi module to send notifications to the user's smartphone, allowing them to monitor the flame detection system remotely.

The flame detection system will be powered by a 9V battery or a USB power supply. We will also add a power switch to the system to turn it on or off when required.

Overall, this project aims to create a reliable and low-cost flame detection system using readily available components and the Arduino Uno microcontroller. The system will be easy to install and use, making it an ideal safety measure for industries, homes, and vehicles.
